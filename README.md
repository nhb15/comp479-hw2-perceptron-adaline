# comp479-hw2-perceptron-adaline

Each model is contained in its own python file.


To run a model, type python3 then the model file name, for example:

python3 perceptron.py

python3 adaline_online_implementation.py

python3 baseline_model.py


The test data sets live in the *test_data_sets.py* file.


For the Perceptron and baseline models, I print out the weights used and the threshold (weight 0). After that, I loop through the data set available to predict on each one, and print this.


The report is *Homework2 Report.pdf*.
